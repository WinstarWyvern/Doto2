            <h3>Hero Lore</h3>
            <p>Little known to the inhabitants of the dry world, Dark Reef is a sunken prison where the worst of the
                sea-bred are sent for crimes against their fellows. It is a razor barbed warren full of murderous
                slithereen, treacherous Deep Ones, sociopathic meranths. In this dim labyrinth, patrolled by eels and
                guarded by enormous anemones, only the vicious survive. Pitched into Dark Reef for crimes unknown, Slark
                spent half a lifetime without kin or kindness, trusting no one, surviving through a combination of
                stealth and ruthlessness, keeping his thoughts and his plans to himself.</p>

            <p>When the infamous Dark Reef Dozen plotted their ill-fated breakout, they kept their plans a perfect
                secret, murdering anyone who could have put the pieces together—but somehow Slark discovered their
                scheme and made a place for himself in it. Ten of the Dozen died in the escape attempt, and two were
                captured, hauled back to Dark Reef, then executed for the entertainment of their fellow inmates. But
                Slark, the unsung thirteenth, used the commotion as cover and slipped away, never to be caught. Now a
                furtive resident of the carnivorous mangrove scrub that grips the southern reach of Shadeshore, Slark
                remains the only successful escapee from Dark Reef.

                        <p>After a short delay, Slark sacrifices some of his life blood, purging debuffs and dealing

                        <p>Slark leaps forward, grabbing the first enemy hero he connects with. That unit is leashed to
                            Slark, and can only move a limited distance away from Slark's landing position.</p>

                        <p>Slark steals the life essence of enemy heroes with his attacks, draining each of their
                            attributes and converting them to bonus Agility. If Slark kills an affected enemy hero, he
                            permanently steals 1 Agility.</p>

                        <p>Slark hides himself in a cloud of shadows, becoming completely invisible and untargetable.
                            Attacking, casting spells, and using items do not reveal Slark, and True Sight does not
                            reveal him either.
                            Additionally, when not visible to the enemy team, Slark gains bonus movement speed and
                            health regeneration.</p>
