            <h3>Hero Lore</h3>
            <p>The Font of Avernus is the source of a family's strength, a crack in primal stones from which vapors of
                prophetic power have issued for generations. Each newborn of the cavernous House Avernus is bathed in
                the black mist, and by this baptism they are given an innate connection to the mystic energies of the
                land. They grow up believing themselves fierce protectors of their lineal traditions, the customs of the
                realm—but what they really are protecting is the Font itself. And the motives of the mist are unclear.
            </p>

            <p>When the infant Abaddon was bathed in the Font, they say something went awry. In the child's eyes there
                flared a light of comprehension that startled all present and set the sacerdotes to whispering. He was
                raised with every expectation of following the path all scions of Avernus took—to train in war, that in
                times of need he might lead the family's army in defense of the ancestral lands. But Abaddon was always
                one apart. Where others trained with weapons, he bent himself to meditation in the presence of the mist.
                He drank deep from the vapors that welled from the Font, learning to blend his spirit with the potency
                that flowed from far beneath the House; he became a creature of the black mist.</p>

            <p>There was bitterness within the House Avernus—elders and young alike accusing him of neglecting his
                responsibilities. But all such accusations stopped when Abaddon rode into battle, and they saw how the
                powers of the mist had given him mastery over life and death beyond those of any lord the House had ever
                known.</p>

                        <p>Abaddon releases a coil of deathly mist that can damage an enemy unit or heal a friendly unit
                            at the cost of some of Abaddon's health.</p>

                        <h3>Aphotic Shield</h3>
                        <p>Summons dark energies around an ally unit, creating a shield that absorbs a set amount of
                            damage before expiring. When the shield is destroyed it will burst and deal damage to the
                            area around it. Performs a strong dispel on cast.</p>

                        <p>Abaddon strikes an enemy with chilling power on each attack, slowing them and causing all
                            units who attack the slowed enemy to gain increased attack speed. If a target gets hit
                            enough times they are silenced and slowed more, while all allied heroes that attack the
                            target will receive an attack speed boost for a short time.</p>

                            damage when his health is below the threshold.</p>
