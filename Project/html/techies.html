            <h3>Hero Lore</h3>
            <p>In the storied saga of Dredger's Bight, no business has ever been more reviled than Techies Demolitions.
                Then again, Dredger's Bight no longer exists. Nor does Toterin. Or even Trapper Town. In fact, if one
                were to track the history of Techies Demolitions they might notice that shortly after Techies appear,
                towns tend to disappear.</p>

            <p>Like every inevitable disaster surrounding Techies, the obliteration of Dredger's Bight began with an
                invention. Tasked with designing a safer way of detonating explosives in the mines beneath the city,
                pyrotechnic prodigies Squee, Spleen, and Spoon developed their most outlandish creation yet: a button
                which, when pressed, would trigger a distant device to spark a fuse.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overeager to test their invention, the trio stuffed barrel after barrel with flamesalt explosives,
                piling every corner of their tiny workshop high with the newly developed remote bombs. From this
                stockpile they plucked a single payload, burying it in a far away field. As they cowered in a ditch,
                Spleen pressed the detonator button. Yet after a moment, nothing happened. Confused, he stood up,
                pressing his button again and again until, finally, an explosion tore a hole in the field. Elated, Squee
                and Spleen turned toward home just as a massive wave of sound and force arrived to knock them over.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bewildered, their ears ringing from the unexpected blast, they gathered in the dingy miasma to see a
                smoking ruin where their workshop once stood. Chunks of wood and stone continued to fall as the yawning
                crater before them slowly deepened into an expanding pit. The whole of Dredger's Bight shuddered, and
                then gradually started to slide into the mines below as its panicked residents fled. Sitting at the edge
                of their sinking home they grinned and giggled, as giddy at the possibilities as they were oblivious to
                the scorn of their former neighbors. They wondered only one thing: how could they trigger an even bigger
                blast?
