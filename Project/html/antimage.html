            <h3>Hero Lore</h3>
            <p>The monks of Turstarkuri watched the rugged valleys below their mountain monastery as wave after wave of
                invaders swept through the lower kingdoms. Ascetic and pragmatic, in their remote monastic eyrie they
                remained aloof from mundane strife, wrapped in meditation that knew no gods or elements of magic. Then
                came the Legion of the Dead God, crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with
                their Unliving Lord's poisonous nihilosophy.</p>

            <p>From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a thousand years, they tore the souls
                and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely
                a fortnight against the assault, and the few monks who bothered to surface from their meditations
                believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to distract them from meditation. They died where
                they sat on their silken cushions. </p>

            <p>Only one youth survived—a pilgrim who had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted
                to the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were first
                slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God's priesthood. With nothing but a few of
                Turstarkuri's prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety of other lands, swearing
                to obliterate not only the Dead God's magic users—but to put an end to magic altogether.

                        <p>Summons dark energies around an ally unit, creating a shield that absorbs a set amount of

                            units who attack the slowed enemy to gain increased attack speed. If a target gets hit
                            enough times they are silenced and slowed more, while all allied heroes that attack the
                            target will receive an attack speed boost for a short time.</p>
